1. **Recipe Name** - It is a good practice to set an appropriate name, it is recommended to be composed of `letters`, `numbers` and `-`, for example: xxx-xxx-xxx
2. **Recipe Description** - Briefly describe the usefulness of this recipe
3. **Recipe matching pattern** - this is more critical, please take a few minutes and carefully read the [Match Patterns](/docs/recipe-development/match-pattern) chapter
4. **Recipe Visibility** - can set whether the recipe is `Public` or `Private` (default: `Private`)
