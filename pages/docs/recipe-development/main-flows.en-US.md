# Main Flows

The recipe editor is one of the core features of DataPicker, it is fully visual and allows you to easily create recipes for any website without coding.

The main process is as follows:

1. **Recipe Basic Information** - allows you to easily find the recipe
2. **Configure table info** - Let DataPicker know where to pull data from?
3. **Configure Field Information** - Let DataPicker know what data to extract?
4. **Configure a set of actions (optional)** - what needs to be done before extracting data?
5. **Configure a set of navigation actions (optional)** - How to navigate to the next page? (Navigation is also an action in nature)

Next, we will take [Github Search Results](https://github.com/search?q=hello+world&type=Repositories) as an example to take you step by step to create your own recipe.
