# Installaton and Registration

## How to install?

The official DataPicker plugin has been reviewed by Google and Microsoft, and you can install it directly from their app store with one click:

- Install in Chrome browser: [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/datapicker-powerful-web-d/baglkjackdnhdpjjcjpkhmemggiklhid)
- Install in Edge browser: [Edge Web Store](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/datapicker-powerful-web/ejmegoaahjcedhklldmdmmgbjoioifje)

Usually, the review time of different app stores is inconsistent, which will lead to different release versions on each browser. Version review is the fastest on Chrome, and it is recommended that you install the latest version.
